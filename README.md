## **Features**

- **File Upload**: Users can upload files to the cloud storage.
- **File Retrieval**: Users can retrieve files using a unique identifier.
- **File Deletion**: Users can delete files from the cloud.
- **Authentication**:
  - Login system with JWT-based authentication.
  - Passwords are securely stored using hashing.
- **Token Expiration**: JWT tokens have a defined expiration time for security.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **Cloud Storage**: [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt for hashing
